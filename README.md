# genetic-trees

This project is a practice in meditative games and genetics.

Left-click to choose a parent tree. When you have two, left-click on the ground to generate a child of that tree. Right-click to clear parent trees.
Use WASD or arrow keys to move.

The child trees are chosen from prefabs, not generated. The genotype of the parent trees determines the appearance and genotype of the child.
